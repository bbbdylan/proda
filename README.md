This is a PyTorch re-implementation of the CVPR 2022 paper [Prompt Distribution Learning (ProDA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03340), reproducing the results on [ELEVATER](https://computer-vision-in-the-wild.github.io/ELEVATER/index.html) benchmark. 

ProDA is the **winner** of the Parameter-Efficiency track at [Image Classification in the Wild (ICinW) Challenge](https://computer-vision-in-the-wild.github.io/eccv-2022/) on the ECCV2022 workshop.
