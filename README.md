# Prompt Distribution Learning (ProDA)
This is a PyTorch re-implementation of the paper [Prompt Distribution Learning (ProDA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03340), reproducing the results on [ELEVATER](https://computer-vision-in-the-wild.github.io/ELEVATER/index.html) benchmark. ProDA is the winner of [Image Classification in the Wild (ICinW)](https://computer-vision-in-the-wild.github.io/ELEVATER/index.html) challenge (parameter-efficiency track) on the ECCV2022 workshop.
